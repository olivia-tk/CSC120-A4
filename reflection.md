Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- What are your initial impressions of how `Encapsulation` affects your programming?
This was the hardest of all assignments so far, because there were so many parts to it and I needed to see how they worked together. It took me a while to understand what the task was, too but going to TA hours helped. 

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
TA hours and office hours!! It was helpful to clarify what the assignment is asking me to do, before I start writing any code.
